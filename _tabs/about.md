### *The code I write almost usually works.* 😉

I began my Powershell journey in 2019 and have since used it in my daily work. I'm currently a Systems Engineer at an educational technology company where I enjoy the opportunity to work with Powershell frequently to make a positive impact.

My experience encompasses both Windows and Linux servers and workstations, scripting, automation, virtualization, and containerization. I have a proven track record of designing, building, and maintaining secure and high-performance systems that create value and drive organizational success through bridging technical solutions with business strategy. My technical expertise includes PowerShell development (both scripts and script modules), REST APIs, integrations, identity and access management platforms, infrastructure, some networking, capacity planning, compliance, and OpEx/CapEx budgeting. I'm big on documentation, technical knowledge management, IT process, and project management.  

Beyond technology, I'm committed to continuous growth and leadership. I have an MBA with a focus in IT Management along with a Bachelor's degree in management. My hands-on experience is complemented by leadership roles, including previously serving as the Assistant Director of Operations for a National Youth Leadership Training program.  

When I'm not working, you’ll find me tinkering with my homelab environment, enjoying film photography, engaging in strategy games, playing racquetball and badminton, or going walking with my wife and our two Corgis.

I enjoy regularly attending the PowerShell Community Call and the Pacific PowerShell User Group, and hope to attend the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit in 2026. I love nerding out about PowerShell, and would love to hear from you on [BlueSky](https://griff.systems/bluesky) or [Signal](https://griff.systems/signal)!
