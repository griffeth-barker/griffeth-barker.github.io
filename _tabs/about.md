### *The code I write almost usually works.* 😉

Experience encompassing both Windows and Linux specializing in scripting, automation, virtualization, and containerization, I have a proven track record of designing, building, and maintaining secure and high-performance systems that create value and drive organizational success through bridging technical solutions with business strategy. My technical expertise includes PowerShell development (both scripts and modules), REST APIs, integrations, identity and access management platforms, infrastructure, and more including some networking, capacity planning, compliance, and OpEx/CapEx budgeting. I'm big on documentation, technical knowledge management, IT process, and project management.  

Beyond technology, I'm committed to continuous growth and leadership. I have an MBA with a focus in IT Management along with a Bachelor's degree in management. My hands-on experience is complemented by leadership roles, including previously serving as the Assistant Director of Operations for a National Youth Leadership Training program.  

When I'm not working, you’ll find me tinkering with my homelab environment, enjoying film photography, engaging in strategy games, playing racquetball and badminton, or going walking with my wife and our two dogs. If you’re looking for someone dedicated to creating value through IT, feel free to connect. Let’s collaborate to solve problems and drive success!
